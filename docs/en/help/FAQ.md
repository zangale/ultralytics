# Ultralytics YOLO Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ section addresses some common questions and issues users might encounter while working with [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) YOLO repositories.

## 1. What is Ultralytics and what does it offer?

Ultralytics is a computer vision AI company that develops and maintains state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation models, primarily focusing on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models. Ultralytics offers:

- [Open-source implementations of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/)
- [Pre-trained models for various computer vision tasks](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/)
- [A Python package for easy integration of YOLO models into projects](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python/)
- [Tools for training, testing, and deploying models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/)
- [Extensive documentation and community support](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)

## 2. How do I install the Ultralytics package?

To install the Ultralytics package, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```
pip install ultralytics
```

For the latest development version, you can install directly from the GitHub repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics.git
```

For more details, refer to the [quickstart guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/).

## 3. What are the system requirements for running Ultralytics models?

Minimum requirements:

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyTorch 1.7 or later
- CUDA-compatible GPU (for GPU acceleration)

Recommended:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.2+
- 8GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ free disk space (for dataset storage and model training)

For more information, visit [YOLO Common Issues](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/yolo-common-issues/).

## 4. How can I train a custom YOLOv8 model on my own dataset?

To train a custom YOLOv8 model:

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLO format (images and corresponding label txt files).
2. Create a YAML file describing your dataset structure and classes.
3. Use the following Python code to start training:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Train the model
results = model.train(data="path/to/your/data.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
```

For detailed instructions, refer to the [training guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/).

## 5. What pretrained models are available in Ultralytics?

Ultralytics offers a range of pretrained YOLOv8 models for various tasks:

- Object Detection: YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l, YOLOv8x
- Instance Segmentation: YOLOv8n-seg, YOLOv8s-seg, YOLOv8m-seg, YOLOv8l-seg, YOLOv8x-seg
- Classification: YOLOv8n-cls, YOLOv8s-cls, YOLOv8m-cls, YOLOv8l-cls, YOLOv8x-cls

These models vary in size and complexity, offering different trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Learn more about [pretrained models](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/).

## 6. How do I perform inference using a trained Ultralytics model?

To perform inference with a trained model:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("path/to/your/model.pt")

# Perform inference
results = model("path/to/image.jpg")

# Process results
for r in results:
    print(r.boxes)  # print bbox predictions
    print(r.masks)  # print mask predictions
    print(r.probs)  # print class probabilities
```

For more details, visit the [prediction guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/).

## 7. Can Ultralytics models be deployed on edge devices or in production environments?

Yes, Ultralytics models can be deployed on various platforms:

- Edge devices: Use TensorRT, ONNX, or OpenVINO for optimized inference on devices like NVIDIA Jetson or Intel Neural Compute Stick.
- Mobile: Convert models to TFLite or Core ML for deployment on Android or iOS devices.
- Cloud: Deploy models using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or PyTorch Serve.
- Web: Use ONNX.js or TensorFlow.js for in-browser inference.

Ultralytics provides export functions to convert models to various formats for deployment. Learn more about [deployment options](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-deployment-options/).

## 8. What's the difference between YOLOv5 and YOLOv8?

Key differences include:

- Architecture: YOLOv8 has an improved backbone and head design.
- Performance: YOLOv8 generally offers better accuracy and speed.
- Tasks: YOLOv8 natively supports object detection, instance segmentation, and classification.
- Codebase: YOLOv8 is implemented in a more modular and extensible manner.
- Training: YOLOv8 includes advanced training techniques like multi-dataset training and hyperparameter evolution.
